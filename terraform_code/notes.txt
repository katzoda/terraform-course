*** Terraform ***
terraform show
- shows everything in the current state

terraform show -json | jq
- it outputs tfstate file as it is in json format

terraform state list
- it's going to list resources:
github_repository.kd-repo
github_repository_file.readme

terraform state show github_repository.kd-repo
- shows all attributes of the specific resource in hcl
- could be copied into main.tf

terraform state show github_repository.kd-repo | grep "description"
- for finding an attribute quickly
- not recommended for automation without extensive testing
